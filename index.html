        <P><span>Abilities:</span><br>Luffy's rubberiness is a result of eating a Devil Fruit called the Gum-Gum Fruit, which makes him immune to electric attacks and most blunt forces, also giving him the ability to stretch his body at will. He uses his elasticity to accelerate part or all of his body to deliver punches, kicks, head butts, and body checks or for propulsion. Like others exposed to Devil Fruit, Luffy cannot swim; when he is submerged in water or contacts the Sea-Prism Stone, he loses his strength and cannot move on his own. In addition to his Devil Fruit powers, he has immense strength, durability, speed, reflexes, agility, endurance and stamina.<br>

Luffy's signature attack is the Gum-Gum Pistol (ゴムゴムの銃ピストル, Gomu Gomu no Pisutoru), a punch which he learned during years of training.
